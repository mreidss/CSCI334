Suggested Solution\r\n\r\nIt would be nice if FishEye support report function based on *numbers of changed files*.\r\n The customer assumed a chart like...\r\n * X-Axis : Time (Day, Week, Month)\r\n * Y-Axis : Number of files that were modified in a given period (In case the files are changed multiple times in the period, it should be counted once)\r\n\r\nh3. Possible workaround\r\n\r\nWe can get the similar information with using [EyeQL|https://confluence.atlassian.com/fisheye/eyeql-reference-guide-298976796.html] and download it as a CSV.\r\nh5. EyeQL query\r\n\r\nTo get the number of files that were changed (added, modified and deleted) on each day, use the following EyeQL query\r\n{noformat}\r\nselect revisions\r\nfrom dir \"/\"\r\nwhere date >= 2016-01-01 and date < 2017-01-01\r\norder by date\r\ngroup by month\r\nreturn count(distinct path), month{noformat}\r\nadjusting the {{dir}} and {{date}} parameters according to needs.

Workaround\r\n- Specify the entire list of revisions to search for:\r\n{noformat}\r\nselect revisions where (csid = 20 or csid = 21 or csid=22)\r\n{noformat}\r\n- Search by timeframe using the {{date}} clause\r\n- create tags for boundary changesets if none exist yet, use those tags in {{between tags}} clause:\r\n{noformat}\r\nselect revisions where between tags [from_tag, to_tag] \r\n{noformat}","customfield_16632":null,"customfield_12431":null,"customfield_12430":null,"customfield_16630":null,"customfield_12433":null,"customfield_10650":null,"customfield_14733":"1|i0yu3z:","customfield_10651":null,"customfield_10530":null,"customfield_12432":null,"customfield_14734":"0|12r2xs:","customfield_12831":null,"customfield_12435":null,"customfield_14731":"0|i27t9z:","customfield_12830":null,"customfield_10653":null,"customfield_12434":null,"customfield_14732":"0|12r3k8:","summary":"As a user, I want to specify a revision range as a search criteria in EyeQL","customfield_17432":null,"customfield_17431":null,"customfield_13230":null,"customfield_15532":null,"customfield_13231":null,"customfield_15530":null,"customfield_17830":null,"customfield_17433":null,"customfield_15932":null,"customfield_15930":null,"customfield_11730":null,"customfield_15931":null,"customfield_12931":null,"environment":null,"duedate":null}},{"expand":"operations,versionedRepresentations,editmeta,changelog,renderedFields","id":"670350","self":"https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/2/issue/670350","key":"FE-6795","fields":{"customfield_12130":null,"customfield_10590":{"self":"https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10450","value":"Unknown","id":"10450"},"customfield_10591":{"self":"https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10456","value":"Unknown","id":"10456"},"customfield_16732":null,"customfield_12131":null,"customfield_10230":null,"customfield_14430":null,"customfield_16730":{"self":"https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/13930","value":"Other","id":"13930"},"fixVersions":[],"resolution":null,"customfield_12531":"Not Started","customfield_11436":"9223372036854775807","customfield_11435":"9223372036854775807","customfield_11437":"9223372036854775807","customfield_17130":null,"lastViewed":null,"customfield_10180":null,"customfield_17531":null,"customfield_17530":null,"priority":{"self":"https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/2/priority/4","iconUrl":"https://jira.atlassian.com/images/icons/priorities/trivial.svg","name":"Low","id":"4"},"customfield_11431":"9223372036854775807","customfield_11434":"9223372036854775807","customfield_11433":"9223372036854775807","labels":["embedded-crowd","performance"],"customfield_10610":null,"aggregatetimeoriginalestimate":null,"timeestimate":null,"versions":[{"self":"https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/2/version/66577","id":"66577","name":"4.3.1","archived":false,"released":true,"releaseDate":"2017-02-21"}],"issuelinks":[{"id":"249390","self":"https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/2/issueLink/249390","type":{"id":"10000","name":"Reference","inward":"is related to","outward":"relates to","self":"https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/2/issueLinkType/10000"},"outwardIssue":{"id":"674649","key":"FE-6809","self":"https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/2/issue/674649","fields":{"summary":"Crowd incremental synchronisation falls back to full synchronisation in some Crowd configurations","status":{"self":"https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/2/status/1","description":"Issue is open and has not yet been accepted by Atlassian.","iconUrl":"https://jira.atlassian.com/images/icons/statuses/open.png","name":"Open","id":"1","statusCategory":{"self":"https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/2/statuscategory/2","id":2,"key":"new","colorName":"blue-gray","name":"To Do"}},"priority":{"self":"https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/2/priority/4","iconUrl":"https://jira.atlassian.com/images/icons/priorities/trivial.svg","name":"Low","id":"4"},"issuetype":{"self":"https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/2/issuetype/4","id":"4","description":"An improvement or enhancement to an existing feature or task.","iconUrl":"https://jira.atlassian.com/secure/viewavatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=51500&avatarType=issuetype","name":"Improvement","subtask":false,"avatarId":51500}}}},{"id":"247284","self":"https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/2/issueLink/247284","type":{"id":"10000","name":"Reference","inward":"is related to","outward":"relates to","self":"https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/2/issueLinkType/10000"},"inwardIssue":{"id":"664508","key":"CRUC-7969","self":"https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/2/issue/664508","fields":{"summary":"Improve performance of getting user groups when nested groups are enabled","status":{"self":"https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/2/status/6","description":"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Integrate FishEye 4.2.1 with JIRA (tested with JIRA 6.4.14 and JIRA 7.2.6) through Application Links\r\n# Ensure that OAuth consumer token has been accepted in both sides, allowing you to see JIRA issue details in FishEye side and commits / reviews in the JIRA issue\r\n# (Likely optional) Create a user mapping, just to make sure that the repository committer will be mapped to a FishEye user\r\n# Enable debug logging in FishEye\r\n# Commit code using smart commits, and containing {{#time 1d}} in the commit message\r\n# Wait until FishEye the new commit shows up in the repository activity stream\r\n# Reload the JIRA ticket, ensuring to be in the {{Work Log}} tab, and check that the time was not logged.\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\nAccording to [Using Smart Commits|https://confluence.atlassian.com/fisheye/using-smart-commits-298976812.html] it should be possible to use the time unit 'd', respective to days, and it should log the number of days specified before the 'd' character in the issue.\r\n\r\nh3.

Summary\r\n\r\nFishEye renders binary file in SVN repository as text when the filename contains *round brackets '(', ')'* and FishEye uses *native SVN* for the indexing. (This problem didn't happen when using *SVNKit*.)\r\nThis is different problem from the one which is mentioned in [this KB|https://confluence.atlassian.com/fishkb/fisheye-renders-binary-file-in-svn-repository-as-text-792498092.html]. Even if {{svn:mime-type}} of the file is set to {{application/octet-stream}}, this problem could be reproduced.\r\n\r\nh3. Environment\r\n* Ubuntu 16.04\r\n* SVN 1.9.3\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Create a SVN repository\r\n# Add any file to the repository and commit it (revision 1)\r\n(i) This step is important. I couldn't reproduce this problem in case that I added the problematic file in the initial commit. You should commit the problematic file *after the initial commit*.\r\n# Add a binary file named \"(test).pptx\" to the repository and commit it (revision 2)\r\n# Make change in the binary file and commit it (revision 3)\r\n# Configure FishEye to use native SVN\r\n# Add the repository to FishEye\r\n# Execute full re-indexing to the repository\r\n# Check the diff between revision 2 and revision 3 on the UI\r\n\r\nh3. Expected Results\r\n\r\n\"(test).pptx\" should be handled as binary.\r\n\r\nh3. Actual Results\r\n\r\n\"(test).pptx\" was handled as text.\r\n \r\nh3. Notes\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned above, in case that we added the problematic file to the repository in the *initial commit*, this problem couldn't be reproduced.\r\nIn order to reproduce this problem, we have to add the file to the repository *after the initial commit*.\r\n\r\nWhen I reproduce this problem on my local, the following SVN commands seemed to be executed while re-indexing.\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n2017-01-20 00:49:25,855 DEBUG [InitPing1 test_native ] fisheye IndexingStats-dump - svn cat -r 3 http://vagrant.vm/svn/test/%28test%29.pptx@3 took 3 millis\r\n2017-01-20 00:49:25,855 DEBUG [InitPing1 test_native ] fisheye IndexingStats-dump - svn info -r HEAD http://vagrant.vm/svn/test/@HEAD took 4 millis\r\n2017-01-20 00:49:25,855 DEBUG [InitPing1 test_native ] fisheye IndexingStats-dump - svn info -R -r 2 http://vagrant.vm/svn/test/%28test%29.pptx@2 took 5 millis\r\n2017-01-20 00:49:25,855 DEBUG [InitPing1 test_native ] fisheye IndexingStats-dump - svn proplist -r 1 http://vagrant.vm/svn/test/test.pptx@1 took 6 millis\r\n2017-01-20 00:49:25,855 DEBUG [InitPing1 test_native ] fisheye IndexingStats-dump - svn diff --summarize -r 2:3 http://vagrant.vm/svn/test/@3 took 7 millis\r\n2017-01-20 00:49:25,855 DEBUG [InitPing1 test_native ] fisheye IndexingStats-dump - svn info -R -r 1 http://vagrant.vm/svn/test@1 took 8 millis\r\n2017-01-20 00:49:25,855 DEBUG [InitPing1 test_native ] fisheye IndexingStats-dump - svn diff -r 2:3 http://vagrant.vm/svn/test@3 took 10 millis\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nh3.Workaround\r\n\r\nPlease use SVNKit instead.","customfield_16632":null,"customfield_12431":null,"customfield_12430":null,"customfield_16630":null,"customfield_14733":"1|i0x40f:","customfield_12433":null,"customfield_10650":null,"customfield_10651":null,"customfield_14734":"0|12pct4:","customfield_10530":null,"customfield_12432":null,"customfield_12831":null,"customfield_12435":null,"customfield_14731":"0|i269e7:","customfield_12830":null,"customfield_10653":null,"customfield_12434":null,"customfield_14732":"0|12pdfk:","summary":"FishEye renders binary file in SVN repository as text when using native SVN","customfield_17432":null,"customfield_17431":null,"customfield_13230":"2017-01-26 09:28:19.629","customfield_15532":null,"customfield_13231":null,"customfield_15530":null,"customfield_17830":null,"customfield_17433":null,"customfield_15932":null,"customfield_15930":null,"customfield_11730":null,"customfield_15931":null,"customfield_12931":null,"environment":null,"duedate":null}},{"expand":"operations,versionedRepresentations,editmeta,changelog,renderedFields","id":"660263","self":"https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/2/issue/660263","key":"FE-6754","fields":{"customfield_12130":null,"customfield_10590":{"self":"https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10450","value":"Unknown","id":"10450"},"customfield_10591":{"self":"https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10456","value":"Unknown","id":"10456"},"customfield_16732":null,"customfield_12131":null,"customfield_10230":null,"customfield_14430":null,"customfield_16730":{"self":"https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/13930","value":"Other","id":"13930"},"fixVersions":[{"self":"https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/2/version/64120","id":"64120","name":"4.2.1","archived":false,"released":true,"releaseDate":"2016-11-09"},{"self":"https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/2/version/63904","id":"63904","name":"4.3.0","archived":false,"released":true,"releaseDate":"2017-01-19"}],"resolution":{"self":"https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/2/resolution/1","id":"1","description":"A fix for this issue is checked into the tree and tested.","name":"Fixed"},"customfield_12531":"Not Started","customfield_11436":"9223372036854775807","customfield_11435":"9223372036854775807","customfield_11437":"9223372036854775807","customfield_17130":{"self":"https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/14432","value":"Minor","id":"14432"},"lastViewed":null,"customfield_10180":null,"customfield_17531":null,"customfield_17530":null,"priority":{"self":"https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/2/priority/3","iconUrl":"https://jira.atlassian.com/images/icons/priorities/minor.svg","name":"Medium","id":"3"},"customfield_11431":"9223372036854775807","customfield_11434":"9223372036854775807","customfield_11433":"9223372036854775807","labels":["cvss-medium","fecru-published","security","xss"],"customfield_10610":null,"aggregatetimeoriginalestimate":null,"timeestimate":null,"versions":[{"self":"https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/2/version/41892","id":"41892","name":"4.0.0","archived":false,"released":true,"releaseDate":"2016-03-15"}],"issuelinks":[],"assignee":null,"status":{"self":"https://jira.atlassian.com/rest/api/2/status/6","description":"The issue is considered finished, the resolution is correct.

Summary\r\nWhen running the *\"Code Metrics Report\"* with a user that does not have access to the repository and the \"Grant read access to anonymous users\" option is not enabled, a NotPermittedException error message is presented to the user.\r\n\r\nThis use case can happen when users share the URL of a report among themselves.\r\n\r\nh3. Steps to Reproduce\r\n# Make sure that the preconditions are met:\r\n## +userB+ does not have access to the repository\r\n## the \"Grant read access to anonymous users\" option is not enabled\r\n# +userA+ retrieves the URL of the \"Code Metrics Report\" and shares it with +userB+\r\n# +userB+ opens the URL\r\n\r\nh3.

Given this situation it is practically useless to have binary files in ones repositories. Especially if the repo contains many binary files, these may bloat the index files and it seems to me that FishEye creates an own copy of every version of every one of them, which can also be huge.\r\n\r\nSo my suggestion is to create an option for excluding all binary files from repositories. The best place for this in my opinion is the _Include/Exclude_ settings page.\r\n\r\nA workaround for this of course (and this is what we are doing) is to create a bunch of exclude rules like\r\n{code:java}\r\n/**/*.png\r\n/**/*.jpg\r\n{code}\r\netc. to exclude our binary files by extension.
